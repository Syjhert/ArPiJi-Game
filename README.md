RPG Turn-based Game
Simple Turn-based battle system without GUI yet. Includes a limited amount of battle items, weapons, and moves. Also includes three types of basic enemy types with respective moves. 
Planning to add GUI to the turn-based battle system first. Next up is the non-battle gameplay and stage-making with a hit of puzzles. However, I am still a beginner, might take a year or two to see good progress. :(
