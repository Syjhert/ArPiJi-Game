RPG Turn-based Game
Simple Turn-based battle system without GUI yet. Includes a limited amount of battle items, weapons, and moves. Also includes three types of basic enemy types with respective moves. 

To do:
- Adding moves to the claymore type weapon. 
- Developing the GUI of the turn-based battle system. 
- Developing the non-battle gameplay and stage-making with a hit of puzzles. 


Bugs:
- UI on showing the stats of weapon lacks a few dash symbol to match the "Crit Damage" stat of the claymore type weapon with the rest of the weapon types.
- Buffs (and possibly debuffs) still have no means of expiring despite having negative number of turn left.

I am still a beginner, might take a year or two to see good progress. :(
