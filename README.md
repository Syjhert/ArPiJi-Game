RPG Turn-based Game
Simple Turn-based battle system without GUI yet. Includes a limited amount of battle items, weapons, and moves. Also includes three types of basic enemy types with respective moves. 

Note: This is focused on OOP Programming and is made by a beginner.

To do:
- Developing the GUI of the turn-based battle system. 
- Developing the non-battle gameplay and stage-making with a hit of puzzles. 


Bugs:
- UI, tabs are inconsistent when printing stats
- (Solved?) Buffs (and possibly debuffs) still have no means of expiring despite having a negative number of turns left.

I am still a beginner, might take a year or two to see good progress. :(
